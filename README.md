## 💼 Featured Projects

## [EmoLearn](https://github.com/arunpentkar/emolearn.git) 
EmoLearn is an advanced AI-powered platform for real-time emotion detection and adaptive learning. By combining facial expression, voice tone, and mouse interaction analysis, it understands user engagement and mood to provide actionable insights. Whenever an emotion is detected, the AI assistant proactively appears to offer support, guidance, or encouragement tailored to the learner’s current state—whether they are confused, bored, or motivated. The assistant helps not only by providing motivation, but also through interactive games and targeted learning support, helping users understand concepts and guiding them toward their best learning condition. Through real-time, personalized interventions such as explanations, motivational messages, and engaging activities, EmoLearn Nexus ensures that help is always timely and relevant, making learning more effective, supportive, and adaptive to each individual's needs.

## [Prediabet](https://github.com/arunpentkar/Diabetes-Prediction.git)
Prediabet is an intelligent diabetes risk assessment platform designed to help users understand their health trends through a clean and intuitive interface. Built with a full-stack architecture using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and a Flask-powered machine learning backend, the system evaluates key health indicators to deliver fast, data-driven risk insights. It also features interactive visualizations that simplify complex health metrics, making early awareness, self-monitoring, and informed decision-making more accessible to every user.

## [AI-Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gesture](https://github.com/arunpentkar/AI--Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gesture.git)
AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gesture is an intelligent computer interaction system that replaces traditional mouse controls with real-time hand-gesture recognition. Using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the project tracks hand landmarks through a webcam and translates gestures into mouse actions such as movement, clicking, dragging, and scrolling. This system improves accessibility and offers a touch-free alternative for navigation, making human–computer interaction more intuitive and hygienic. The application runs efficiently in real time and demonstrates strong practical use of computer vision, gesture detection, and AI-driven control systems.
